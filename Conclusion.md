						CONCLUSION


	Gaussian Process Classification is a powerful machine learning technique that can be 
	used to predict and classify data based on past observations. By analyzing building designs 
	using this technique, you can identify factors that contribute to high energy consumption 
	and design buildings that consume less power. 
	Reducing energy consumption in buildings is not only cost-effective but also critical 
	for environmental sustainability. Buildings account for a significant portion of global 
	energy consumption and carbon emissions. By optimizing energy consumption in 
	buildings, architects can help reduce the overall carbon footprint and contribute to a more 
	sustainable future. 

	In addition to cost savings and environmental benefits, buildings that consume less 
	power also provide a more comfortable and healthy living environment for occupants. By 
	reducing energy waste and optimizing the use of resources, architects can create buildings 
	that are not only efficient but also provide a high level of comfort and quality of life. 
	The results of the classification models were evaluated and compared as shown 
	earlier. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 95% when Gaussian Process classifier 
	was used, indicating excellent performance among the other classifiers.
