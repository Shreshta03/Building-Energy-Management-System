Building energy management system

Electricity is a national asset and every effort should be made to
prevent its wastage. There are two ways in which we can save power
and prevent its wastage. One is reducing the amount of power we
use. That is, switching off the fans,lights, and etc. when not in use,
which are what we are all trying to do right now and work on. The
other factor is trying to reduce the amount of power being wasted by
ensuring we build it properly and managing the power supply and
various factors properly. The building energy management depends
on various design and harvesting factors.Design factors include
provision of false ceilings, automated doors and implementation of
slab system of charges. Harvesting factors include the provision of
additional power sources like solar/Biomass power and proper
maintenance of electrical appliances.

In the existing systems the architects are designing the building
without any machine learning techniques. All the checks while
managing the building are done manually and there is always a
factor or error that is missed. The purpose of this proposed system
is to assist the architects while designing the buildings and help
manage them by analyzing the dataset comprising of the design
and harvest factors of the building by using Quadratic
Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Process Classifier, Gradient
Boosting and Extra Trees Classification towards energy harvesting
and optimization
